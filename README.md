# Crowdfunding
Crowdfunding is basically a process of collecting a huge part of the crowd to pay a certain amount of money to invest in an idea/product. The investors invest in such ideas by keeping the promise that when the idea gets success, they will be getting first access to it. The main motto of crowdfunding is to engage enough crowd with your upcoming project and getting necessary funds.
